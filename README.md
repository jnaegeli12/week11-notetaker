## Installation
Use `npm i express` to install the dependencies. Other dependencies are built-in node functions. This application runs on an express server, so after downloading the files, it will need to be committed to heroku for use.
## Usage
In the browser, click "Get Started" to go to the /notes page where you can write a title and text for each note, save it with the save icon in the top right corner, and delete notes you don't need anymore by clicking the trash can icon by each note.
